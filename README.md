### Core Problem Statement

**"What are ways that those who cannot see or hear be able to interact with the world like those who can?"**

MaxSight answers this by implementing four barrier-removal methods from accessibility research:

1. **Environmental Structuring**: Labels surroundings in ways users can understand
2. **Clear Multimodal Communication**: Visual, audio, and haptic feedback
3. **Skill Development Across Senses**: Addresses different senses for information input
4. **Routine Workflow**: Adapts tasks to usage patterns and needs

### What Makes MaxSight Different

- **WHAT**: Object class (door, stairs, vehicle, person) - 91 COCO classes + 200+ accessibility classes
- **WHERE**: Precise bounding box position (for directional cues)
- **HOW FAR**: Distance zones (near/medium/far)
- **HOW URGENT**: Urgency level (safe/caution/warning/danger) for safety
- **HOW FINDABLE**: Object findability scores (for users with low vision)
- **SCENE CONTEXT**: Natural language scene descriptions
- **ACCESSIBILITY METRICS**: Contrast sensitivity, glare risk, navigation difficulty

### Two-Stage Inference Pipeline

The core architectural decision is the **two-stage inference pipeline** that separates safety-critical predictions from enhancement features.

#### Stage A: Fast Safety Pass (<150ms, every frame)

**Purpose**: Provide safety-critical information that must never be blocked.

**Backbone**: **ALWAYS ResNet50 + FPN** (safety guarantee)
- ResNet50: Proven, fast, predictable
- FPN: Multi-scale feature extraction for objects of all sizes
- No hybrid backbone, no temporal processing (guarantees speed)

**Heads**: Tier 1 safety-critical heads only
- **Objectness**: Is there an object? `[B, H*W]`
- **Classification**: What object? `[B, H*W, 91]`
- **Box Regression**: Where is it? `[B, H*W, 4]`
- **Distance Zones**: How far? `[B, H*W, 3]`
- **Urgency**: How dangerous? `[B, 4]`
- **Uncertainty**: Model confidence `[B, 1]`

**Properties**:
- Highest loss priority in training
- Target: <150ms per frame
- Never blocked by Tier 2 or Tier 3
- Always ResNet50+FPN backbone (no hybrid, no temporal)

**Decision Point**: After Stage A completes, system decides whether to run Stage B:
- Skip Stage B if `latency >200ms` OR `uncertainty >0.7`
- This ensures Stage A always completes, even under load

#### Stage B: Context Pass (opportunistic, tier-dependent)

**Backbone**: Hybrid CNN-ViT (T2+) + Temporal (T5+)
- Hybrid CNN-ViT: Combines CNN efficiency with ViT global attention
- Temporal: ConvLSTM + TimeSformer for temporal modeling (T5 only)
- Processes raw images (not Stage A features) for independent processing

**Heads**: Tier 2 & Tier 3 context-rich heads
- **Tier 2**: Motion, Therapy State, ROI Priority, Navigation Difficulty, Findability
- **Tier 3**: Scene Description, OCR, Scene Graph, Sound Events, Personalization, Predictive Alerts

**Properties**:
- Can be skipped if Stage A latency/uncertainty thresholds exceeded
- Graceful degradation: If Stage B fails, Stage A results still returned
- Asynchronous: Some Tier 3 heads run in background threads
### Tiered Head Architecture
Heads are organized into 3 tiers by criticality:
#### Tier 1: Safety-Critical (Never Disabled)
| **Objectness** | Is there an object? | `[B, H*W]` | Every frame |
| **Classification** | What object? | `[B, H*W, 91]` | Every frame |
| **Box Regression** | Where is it? | `[B, H*W, 4]` | Every frame |
| **Distance Zones** | How far? | `[B, H*W, 3]` | Every frame |
| **Urgency** | How dangerous? | `[B, 4]` | Every frame |
| **Uncertainty** | Model confidence | `[B, 1]` | Every frame |

**Properties**:
- Highest loss priority in training
- Target: <150ms per frame
- Never blocked by Tier 2 or Tier 3
- Always ResNet50+FPN backbone (no hybrid, no temporal)

#### Tier 2: Navigation & Context (Can Degrade)

| **Motion** | Object movement | `[B, 2, H, W]` | Every N frames |
| **Therapy State** | Fatigue, depth, contrast | Dict | Every N frames |
| **ROI Priority** | Region prioritization | `[B, N]` | Every N frames |
| **Navigation Difficulty** | Scene complexity | `[B, 1]` | Every N frames |
| **Findability** | Object findability | `[B, H*W]` | Every N frames |

**Properties**:
- Can be throttled (every N frames)
- Can be delayed if Tier 1 needs resources
- Graceful degradation if disabled

#### Tier 3: Enhancement & Therapy (Optional)

| **Scene Description** | Natural language | List[str] | Background |
| **OCR** | Text detection/recognition | Dict | Background |
| **Scene Graph** | Spatial/semantic relations | Dict | Background |
| **Sound Events** | Audio classification | Dict | Background |
| **Personalization** | User adaptations | Dict | Background |
| **Predictive Alerts** | Hazard anticipation | Dict | Background |
| **Retrieval** | Knowledge augmentation | Advisory | Async, non-blocking |

**Properties**:
- Optional (can be disabled)
- Asynchronous (background thread)
- Never blocks Tier 1 or Tier 2
- **Advisory only** (never drives safety decisions)

### Capability Tiers

The system supports progressive tier enablement:

| **T0** | BASELINE_CNN | ResNet50+FPN, Tier 1 heads | ~29M | Cloud GPU |
| **T1** | EDGE | + Attention, Tier 2 heads | ~50M | Cloud GPU |
| **T2** | HYBRID_VIT | + Hybrid CNN-ViT, Motion, Therapy | ~210M | Cloud GPU |
| **T3** | CROSS_MODAL | + OCR, Scene Description, Scene Graph | ~250M | Cloud GPU |
| **T4** | CROSS_MODAL | + Audio, Retrieval | ~280M | Cloud GPU |
| **T5** | TEMPORAL | + Temporal (ConvLSTM, TimeSformer) | ~320M | Cloud GPU |

**All tiers require cloud GPU (CUDA) for training.**

### Key Architectural Guarantees

1. **Stage A Always ResNet50+FPN**: No hybrid backbone, no temporal processing
   - **Mathematical Guarantee**: `backbone_A = ResNet50 + FPN` (hard-coded, no conditional logic)
   - **Implementation**: `_forward_stage_a_backbone()` method explicitly uses ResNet50+FPN only
   - **Why**: ResNet50+FPN is fast (<150ms), predictable, and well-tested. Hybrid backbones are slower and less predictable.

2. **Stage B Uses Raw Images**: Hybrid backbone processes raw images, not Stage A features
   - **Mathematical Guarantee**: `backbone_B(images_raw) ≠ backbone_B(features_A)`
   - **Implementation**: Stage B backbone receives original images, not Stage A features
   - **Why**: Ensures Stage B can extract different features than Stage A (complementary, not redundant)

3. **Temporal Only in Stage B**: Temporal processing uses Stage A features as input
   - **Mathematical Guarantee**: `temporal_features = TemporalEncoder(features_A)`
   - **Implementation**: Temporal encoder receives Stage A FPN features, not raw images
   - **Why**: Temporal processing is expensive. Using Stage A features is more efficient than re-processing raw images.

4. **Retrieval is Async**: Non-blocking, advisory only
   - **Mathematical Guarantee**: `retrieval_output = async_retrieval(query)`
   - **Implementation**: Retrieval runs in background thread, never blocks inference
   - **Why**: Retrieval can take 100-500ms. Making it async ensures it never delays safety-critical predictions.

5. **Safety First**: Stage A completes before Stage B decision
   - **Mathematical Guarantee**: `t_A < t_decision` (Stage A completes before decision point)
   - **Implementation**: Decision point is after Stage A forward pass completes
   - **Why**: Safety predictions must be available before deciding whether to run Stage B.

6. **Fail-Safe**: High latency/uncertainty → skip Stage B, return Stage A only
   - **Mathematical Guarantee**: `if t_A > 200ms OR uncertainty > 0.7: skip_B = True`
   - **Implementation**: Decision logic checks latency and uncertainty before Stage B
   - **Why**: If Stage A is slow or uncertain, Stage B is unlikely to help and wastes resources.

### Detailed Architecture: ResNet50+FPN (Stage A)

**ResNet50 Forward Pass**:
```
Input: [B, 3, 224, 224]

# Stem
x = Conv2d(3, 64, 7x7, stride=2)  # [B, 64, 112, 112]
x = BatchNorm2d(64)
x = ReLU()
x = MaxPool2d(3x3, stride=2)     # [B, 64, 56, 56]

# Stage 1 (Layer1)
C2 = ResBlock(x, channels=64, num_blocks=3)   # [B, 256, 56, 56]

# Stage 2 (Layer2)
C3 = ResBlock(C2, channels=128, num_blocks=4)  # [B, 512, 28, 28]

# Stage 3 (Layer3)
C4 = ResBlock(C3, channels=256, num_blocks=6) # [B, 1024, 14, 14]

# Stage 4 (Layer4)
C5 = ResBlock(C4, channels=512, num_blocks=3) # [B, 2048, 7, 7]
```

**FPN Forward Pass**:
```
# Bottom-up pathway (already computed: C2, C3, C4, C5)

# Top-down pathway
P5 = Conv1x1(C5)                    # [B, 256, 7, 7]
P4 = Conv1x1(C4) + Upsample(P5)      # [B, 256, 14, 14]
P3 = Conv1x1(C3) + Upsample(P4)      # [B, 256, 28, 28]
P2 = Conv1x1(C2) + Upsample(P3)     # [B, 256, 56, 56]

# Lateral connections (1x1 conv to match channels)
# Upsample = bilinear upsampling (2x)

Where:
- P2, P3, P4, P5 = FPN feature maps at different scales
- All have same channels (256) but different spatial resolutions
- P2: finest detail (56x56), P5: coarsest detail (7x7)
```

**Fused Features for Detection**:
```
# Resize all to same spatial size (P4 size: 14x14)
P3_resized = Interpolate(P3, size=(14, 14))  # [B, 256, 14, 14]
P4 = P4                                      # [B, 256, 14, 14]
P5_resized = Interpolate(P5, size=(14, 14)) # [B, 256, 14, 14]

# Concatenate along channel dimension
Fused = Concat([P3_resized, P4, P5_resized], dim=1)  # [B, 768, 14, 14]

Where:
- 768 = 256 * 3 (three FPN levels concatenated)
- 14x14 = 196 spatial locations (each can predict an object)
- Multi-scale features at same resolution enable detection at all scales
```

### Detailed Architecture: Hybrid CNN-ViT (Stage B)

**CNN Branch Processing**:
```
# Same as Stage A ResNet50+FPN
C2, C3, C4, C5 = ResNet50(images)
P2, P3, P4, P5 = FPN([C2, C3, C4, C5])

# Global pooling for fusion
F_cnn = [GlobalAvgPool(P2), GlobalAvgPool(P3), GlobalAvgPool(P4), GlobalAvgPool(P5)]
F_cnn_concat = Concat(F_cnn, dim=1)  # [B, 1024] (256 * 4)
```

**ViT Branch Processing**:
```
# Patch embedding
Patches = PatchEmbed(images)  # [B, 196, 768]
  Where: 196 = (224/16)² patches, 768 = embedding dimension

# Add positional encoding
Z_0 = Patches + PositionEmbedding  # [B, 196, 768]

# Transformer blocks (12 layers)
Z_l = TransformerBlock_l(Z_{l-1})  # l = 1...12
  Where each TransformerBlock:
    Z_l = LayerNorm(Z_{l-1} + MultiHeadAttention(Z_{l-1}))
    Z_l = LayerNorm(Z_l + FFN(Z_l))

# CLS token (first token)
Z_cls = Z_12[:, 0, :]  # [B, 768]
```

**Cross-Layer Connections (Bidirectional)**:
```
# CNN → ViT (enhance ViT with CNN features)
for each FPN level P_i:
    P_i_proj = Conv1x1(P_i)  # Project to ViT dimension [B, 768, H, W]
    P_i_pooled = AdaptiveAvgPool2d(P_i_proj, size=(14, 14))  # Match patch grid
    P_i_flat = Flatten(P_i_pooled)  # [B, 196, 768]
    
    # Add to ViT patches (residual connection)
    Z_l = Z_l + α * P_i_flat  # α = 0.1 (learnable)

# ViT → CNN (enhance CNN with ViT global context)
Z_vit_spatial = Reshape(Z_12, spatial_dims=(14, 14))  # [B, 768, 14, 14]
Z_vit_proj = Conv1x1(Z_vit_spatial)  # Project to CNN dimension [B, 256, 14, 14]

for each FPN level P_i:
    P_i_resized = Interpolate(Z_vit_proj, size=P_i.shape[2:])
    P_i = P_i + α * P_i_resized  # Residual connection

Where:
- α = 0.1 (learnable cross-layer scaling factor, constrained with sigmoid)
- Bidirectional: CNN provides local features, ViT provides global context
```

**Fusion Methods**:
```
# Method 1: Weighted Fusion (default, most stable)
β = learnable_weight  # Typically initialized to 0.5
F_fused = β * F_cnn_concat + (1 - β) * Z_cls  # [B, 1024] or [B, 768]

# Method 2: Cross-Attention Fusion (research mode)
Q = Linear(F_cnn_concat)  # Query from CNN [B, 1, D]
K = Linear(Z_cls)         # Key from ViT [B, 1, D]
V = Linear(Z_cls)         # Value from ViT [B, 1, D]

Attn = Softmax(QK^T / √d) * V  # [B, 1, D]
F_fused = FFN(Attn.squeeze(1))  # [B, D]

Where:
- d = attention dimension (typically 512)
- Cross-attention allows CNN to "query" ViT for relevant global context
```

### Detailed Architecture: Temporal Processing (T5 Only)

**ConvLSTM Processing**:
```
# Input: Stage A features [B, T, C, H, W]
# T = temporal sequence length (e.g., 8 frames)

# ConvLSTM forward pass
h_t, c_t = ConvLSTM(x_t, h_{t-1}, c_{t-1})

Where:
- h_t = hidden state [B, C_hidden, H, W]
- c_t = cell state [B, C_hidden, H, W]
- ConvLSTM operations:
  i_t = σ(Conv(x_t) + Conv(h_{t-1}) + b_i)  # Input gate
  f_t = σ(Conv(x_t) + Conv(h_{t-1}) + b_f)  # Forget gate
  o_t = σ(Conv(x_t) + Conv(h_{t-1}) + b_o)  # Output gate
  c_t = f_t * c_{t-1} + i_t * tanh(Conv(x_t) + Conv(h_{t-1}))
  h_t = o_t * tanh(c_t)
```

**TimeSformer Processing**:
```
# Input: Stage A features [B, T, C, H, W]
# Reshape to patches
Patches = Reshape(features, [B, T*H*W, C])  # [B, T*196, C]

# Temporal attention (across time)
Z_temporal = MultiHeadAttention(Patches, Patches, Patches)  # [B, T*196, C]

# Spatial attention (within frame)
Z_spatial = []
for t in range(T):
    frame_patches = Z_temporal[:, t*196:(t+1)*196, :]
    Z_spatial_t = MultiHeadAttention(frame_patches, frame_patches, frame_patches)
    Z_spatial.append(Z_spatial_t)
Z_spatial = Concat(Z_spatial, dim=1)  # [B, T*196, C]

# Combine
Z_combined = Z_temporal + Z_spatial  # Residual connection
```

**Motion Feature Extraction**:
```
# Optical flow estimation from temporal features
Flow = MotionHead(temporal_features)  # [B, 2, H, W]
  Where: Flow[:, 0, :, :] = horizontal motion (u)
         Flow[:, 1, :, :] = vertical motion (v)

# Motion magnitude
Motion_mag = √(u² + v²)  # [B, H, W]

# Motion direction
Motion_dir = atan2(v, u)  # [B, H, W] (radians)
```

## Data Flow & Processing Pipeline

### Complete Data Flow
### Data Pipeline Components

#### 1. Dataset Loading (`ml/data/dataset.py`)

**MaxSightDataset** - Complete Implementation Details:

**COCO Format Parsing**:
```python
# Annotation structure:
{
  "images": [{"id": 1, "file_name": "image.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}],
  "annotations": [{
    "id": 1,
    "image_id": 1,
    "category_id": 1,  # COCO class ID
    "bbox": [x, y, width, height],  # Absolute coordinates
    "area": 1234.5,
    "iscrowd": 0
  }],
  "categories": [{"id": 1, "name": "person", "supercategory": "person"}]
}

# Normalization process:
bbox_normalized = [
  (x + width/2) / image_width,   # x_center
  (y + height/2) / image_height,  # y_center
  width / image_width,            # normalized width
  height / image_height           # normalized height
]
```

**Distance Estimation Algorithm**:
```python
# Distance zones computed from bounding box size:
box_area = bbox[2] * bbox[3]  # width * height (normalized)
image_area = 1.0  # normalized

# Heuristic: larger boxes = closer objects
if box_area > 0.1:  # >10% of image
    zone = 0  # NEAR
elif box_area > 0.01:  # >1% of image
    zone = 1  # MEDIUM
else:
    zone = 2  # FAR
```

**Urgency Estimation Algorithm**:
```python
# Urgency computed from object class and context:
urgency_map = {
    'person': 1,  # caution (could be moving)

**Condition-Specific Preprocessing**:
```python
# Cataracts (blur simulation):
if condition == 'cataracts':
    # Apply Gaussian blur
    kernel_size = 5
    sigma = 1.5
    image = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (kernel_size, kernel_size), sigma)
    
    # Reduce contrast
    image = image * 0.8 + 0.1  # Reduce contrast by 20%

# Glaucoma (peripheral vision loss):
if condition == 'glaucoma':
    # Create mask for central vision only
    h, w = image.shape[:2]
    center = (w//2, h//2)
    radius = min(w, h) * 0.3  # 30% of image size
    mask = np.zeros((h, w), dtype=np.uint8)
    cv2.circle(mask, center, int(radius), 255, -1)
    image = cv2.bitwise_and(image, image, mask=mask)
    
    # Darken peripheral regions
    peripheral_mask = 1.0 - (mask / 255.0)
    image = image * (1.0 - 0.5 * peripheral_mask)

# AMD (central vision loss):
if condition == 'amd':
    # Darken central region
    h, w = image.shape[:2]
    center = (w//2, h//2)
    radius = min(w, h) * 0.2  # 20% of image size

    central_mask = mask / 255.0
    image = image * (1.0 - 0.7 * central_mask)  # Darken center by 70%

# Retinitis Pigmentosa (night blindness):
if condition == 'retinitis_pigmentosa':
    # Brighten image
    image = image * 1.5  # Increase brightness by 50%
    image = np.clip(image, 0, 1)  # Clip to valid range
    
    # Enhance edges
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
    edges = cv2.Canny((gray * 255).astype(np.uint8), 50, 150)
    image = image + 0.1 * cv2.cvtColor(edges, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2RGB)
```

**Audio Feature Extraction (MFCC)**:
```python
# MFCC extraction process:
# 1. Pre-emphasis filter (high-pass)
y_preemph = np.append(y[0], y[1:] - 0.97 * y[:-1])

# 2. Windowing (Hamming window)
windowed = y_preemph * np.hamming(len(y_preemph))

# 3. FFT
fft = np.fft.rfft(windowed)

# 4. Mel filterbank
mel_filters = create_mel_filterbank(n_mels=13, n_fft=512, sample_rate=16000)
mel_spectrum = np.dot(mel_filters, np.abs(fft) ** 2)

# 5. Log
log_mel = np.log(mel_spectrum + 1e-10)

# 6. DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)
mfcc = scipy.fft.dct(log_mel, type=2, norm='ortho')[:13]

# Result: [13] MFCC coefficients per frame
# For 1 second audio at 16kHz with 25ms frames: ~40 frames
# Final: [40, 13] → flattened to [520] → downsampled to [128]
```

**Synthetic Annotation Generation**:
```python
# For missing annotations, generate synthetic labels:
def generate_synthetic_annotations(image, existing_annotations):
    # 1. Detect text regions (OCR)
    text_regions = detect_text_regions(image)
    
    # 2. Detect common accessibility objects
    accessibility_objects = detect_accessibility_objects(image)
    # e.g., door handles, handrails, braille signs
    
    # 3. Estimate distance from object size
    for obj in accessibility_objects:
        obj['distance_zone'] = estimate_distance_from_size(obj['bbox'])
        obj['urgency'] = estimate_urgency_from_class(obj['class'])
    
    # 4. Combine with existing annotations
    all_annotations = existing_annotations + accessibility_objects
    
    return all_annotations
```

- Image preprocessing: Condition-specific transformations (13 vision conditions)
- Audio feature extraction: MFCC features from raw audio waveforms
- Synthetic annotation generation: Fills missing labels for accessibility objects

```

**Synchronized Multi-Modal Augmentation**:

    # (e.g., if image is flipped, audio channels are swapped)
    
    # 1. Geometric transform (affects both)

    # If image is time-stretched, audio should match
    # (for video sequences)
    
    return image, audio, bboxes

# - GPU waits for data
# - Trade-off: More memory usage, but 2-3x impact throughput run
```

**Configuration Details**:
- `num_workers: 8` (increased from 4 for GPU feeding)
  - **Rationale**: Model is compute-bound. GPU spends time on forward/backward pass. 8 workers ensure data is ready when GPU needs it.
  - **Memory Impact**: ~2GB per worker (for image loading)
  - **Throughput Improvement**: 2-3x faster than 4 workers
  
- `batch_size: 4-16` (tier-dependent)
  - **T0 (29M)**: batch_size=16 (fits in GPU memory)
  - **T2 (210M)**: batch_size=8 (with gradient accumulation)
  - **T5 (320M)**: batch_size=4 (with gradient accumulation=8, effective batch=32)
  
- `pin_memory: True` (faster GPU transfer)
  - **What it does**: Pins data in CPU memory, enables faster CPU→GPU transfer
  - **Speedup**: ~10-20% faster data loading
  - **Memory**: Slightly higher CPU memory usage
  
- `persistent_workers: True` (keep workers alive)
  - **What it does**: Keeps worker processes alive between epochs
  - **Speedup**: Eliminates worker startup overhead
  - **Memory**: Workers stay in memory (acceptable trade-off)
  
- `prefetch_factor: 2` (prefetch batches)
  - **What it does**: Each worker prefetches 2 batches ahead
  - **Speedup**: Reduces data loading latency
  - **Memory**: 2x batch memory per worker

## Training Flow & Hyperparameter Strategy

### Mathematical Foundations

#### Loss Functions - Complete Formulations

**1. Objectness Loss (Focal Loss)**
```
L_obj = -α(1 - p_t)^γ log(p_t)

Where:
- p_t = σ(logits) if target=1, else 1-σ(logits)
- α = 0.25 (focusing parameter)
- γ = 2.0 (modulating factor)
- σ = sigmoid function
```

**Purpose**: Handles class imbalance (many background locations vs few object locations). Focal loss downweights easy negatives and focuses on hard examples.

**2. Classification Loss (Focal Cross-Entropy)**
```
L_cls = -α(1 - p_t)^γ log(p_t)

Where:
- p_t = softmax(logits)[target_class]
- α = 0.25
- γ = 2.0
```

**Purpose**: Handles class imbalance in object detection (many "person" examples vs few "fire hydrant" examples).

**3. Box Regression Loss (Smooth L1 / Huber Loss)**
```
L_box = {
  0.5 * (x - x_gt)² / β    if |x - x_gt| < β
  |x - x_gt| - 0.5 * β     otherwise
}

Where:
- x = predicted box coordinates [x_center, y_center, width, height]
- x_gt = ground truth box coordinates
- β = 1.0 (transition point)
```

**Purpose**: Smooth L1 is less sensitive to outliers than L2, but smoother than L1 near zero. This helps with box regression stability.

**4. Distance Zone Loss (Weighted Cross-Entropy)**
```
L_dist = -Σ w_i * log(softmax(logits)[target_zone])

Where:
- w_i = class weight for zone i (near/medium/far)
- Zones: 0=near, 1=medium, 2=far
```

**Purpose**: Handles imbalance in distance zones (more "near" examples than "far" examples).

**5. Urgency Loss (Focal Loss with Class Weights)**
```
L_urg = -w_target * α(1 - p_t)^γ log(p_t)

Where:
- w_target = [1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0] for [safe, caution, warning, danger]
- p_t = softmax(logits)[target_urgency]
- α = 0.25, γ = 2.0
```

**Purpose**: Heavily weights danger predictions (false negatives are catastrophic for safety).

**6. Depth Loss (Uncertainty-Weighted L1)**
```
L_depth = |d - d_gt| * exp(-u) + u

Where:
- d = predicted depth
- d_gt = ground truth depth
- u = predicted uncertainty (learned)
```

**Purpose**: Uncertainty-weighted loss (Kendall & Gal formulation). The model learns to predict its own uncertainty, downweighting errors in uncertain regions.

**7. Motion Loss (Optical Flow Loss)**
```
L_motion = ||flow_pred - flow_gt||₂² + λ_smooth * R_smooth(flow_pred)

Where:
- flow_pred = [u, v] predicted optical flow
- flow_gt = ground truth optical flow
- R_smooth = smoothness regularization term
- λ_smooth = 0.1 (smoothness weight)
```

**Purpose**: Predicts pixel-level motion vectors while maintaining spatial smoothness.

#### GradNorm Algorithm - Complete Mathematical Formulation

**GradNorm** automatically balances gradients across multiple tasks to prevent gradient warfare.

**Step 1: Compute Gradient Norms**
```
For each task i:
  L_i^w = w_i * L_i  (weighted loss)
  ∇_i = ∇_θ L_i^w  (gradients w.r.t. shared parameters θ)
  G_i = ||∇_i||₂  (gradient norm)
```

**Step 2: Compute Relative Training Rates**
```
L_i^rel = L_i / L_i^0  (relative loss: current / initial)

Where:
- L_i^0 = initial loss value for task i (recorded on first iteration)
- L_i = current loss value for task i
```

**Step 3: Compute Target Gradient Norms**
```
Ḡ = (1/N) * Σ G_i  (average gradient norm)

r_i = (L_i^rel)^α  (relative inverse training rate)

G_i^target = Ḡ * r_i  (target gradient norm)
```

**Where:**
- `α = 1.5` (restoring force hyperparameter)
- Higher α = stronger balancing force
- `r_i` measures how far task i is from its initial loss

**Step 4: Compute GradNorm Loss**
```
L_gradnorm = Σ |G_i - G_i^target|
```

**Step 5: Update Task Weights**
```
∇_w L_gradnorm = ∂L_gradnorm / ∂w_i

w_i ← w_i - η * ∇_w L_gradnorm
```

**Where:**
- `η = 0.025` (learning rate for weight updates)
- Weights updated every N iterations (typically 100)

**Intuition**: Tasks with higher relative loss (slower learning) get higher gradient norms, which means they get more learning signal. This prevents dominant tasks from overwhelming rare tasks.

#### Two-Stage Inference - Mathematical Guarantees

**Stage A: Safety Guarantee**
```
t_A = time(ResNet50 + FPN + Tier1_Heads)
P(skip_B) = {
  1  if t_A > 200ms OR uncertainty > 0.7
  0  otherwise
}
```

**Where:**
- `t_A` = Stage A latency
- `uncertainty` = model confidence (0-1)
- `P(skip_B)` = probability of skipping Stage B

**Mathematical Guarantee**: Stage A always completes before Stage B decision. This ensures safety-critical predictions are never blocked.

**Stage B: Opportunistic Enhancement**
```
if P(skip_B) == 0:
  t_B = time(Hybrid_CNN_ViT + Tier2_3_Heads)
  outputs = StageA_outputs ∪ StageB_outputs
else:
  outputs = StageA_outputs
```

**Where:**
- `t_B` = Stage B latency (if executed)
- `∪` = union of outputs

**Mathematical Guarantee**: Stage B outputs never override Stage A safety predictions. Stage B only adds enhancement features.

#### FPN Feature Extraction - Mathematical Formulation

**Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) extracts multi-scale features:**

```
C2, C3, C4, C5 = ResNet50_stages(images)

P5 = Conv1x1(C5)  # Top-down pathway
P4 = Conv1x1(C4) + Upsample(P5)
P3 = Conv1x1(C3) + Upsample(P4)
P2 = Conv1x1(C2) + Upsample(P3)

Where:
- C2, C3, C4, C5 = ResNet50 feature maps at different scales
- P2, P3, P4, P5 = FPN feature maps (all same channels, different resolutions)
- Upsample = bilinear upsampling
```

**Fused Features for Detection:**
```
P3_resized = Interpolate(P3, size=P4.shape[2:])
P5_resized = Interpolate(P5, size=P4.shape[2:])
Fused = Concat([P3_resized, P4, P5_resized], dim=1)
```

**Where:**
- `Interpolate` = bilinear interpolation to match spatial dimensions
- `Concat` = channel-wise concatenation
- Result: Multi-scale features at same spatial resolution

#### Hybrid CNN-ViT Backbone - Mathematical Operations

**CNN Branch:**
```
X_cnn = ResNet50(images)
F_cnn = FPN(X_cnn)  # [P2, P3, P4, P5]
F_cnn_global = GlobalAvgPool(F_cnn)  # [B, C_cnn]
```

**ViT Branch:**
```
Patches = PatchEmbed(images)  # [B, N, D_vit]
  Where: N = (224/16)² = 196 patches, D_vit = 768

Z_0 = Patches + PositionEmbedding
Z_l = TransformerBlock_l(Z_{l-1})  # l = 1...12
Z_cls = Z_0[CLS_token]  # [B, D_vit]
```

**Cross-Layer Connections:**
```
# CNN → ViT
F_cnn_proj = Conv1x1(F_cnn)  # Project to ViT dimension
F_cnn_pooled = AdaptivePool(F_cnn_proj, size=patch_grid)
Z_l = Z_l + α * F_cnn_pooled  # Residual connection

# ViT → CNN
Z_vit_spatial = Reshape(Z_l, spatial_dims)  # [B, D_vit, H, W]
F_vit_proj = Conv1x1(Z_vit_spatial)  # Project to CNN dimension
F_cnn = F_cnn + α * F_vit_proj  # Residual connection

Where:
- α = 0.1 (learnable cross-layer scaling factor)
- AdaptivePool = adaptive average pooling to match spatial dimensions
```

**Fusion:**
```
# Weighted fusion (default, most stable)
F_fused = β * F_cnn_global + (1 - β) * Z_cls

# Cross-attention fusion (research mode)
Q = Linear(F_cnn_global)  # Query from CNN
K, V = Linear(Z_cls)  # Key, Value from ViT
Attn = Softmax(QK^T / √d) * V
F_fused = FFN(Attn)

Where:
- β = learnable weight (default 0.5)
- d = dimension of attention (typically 512)
- FFN = feedforward network
```

### Hyperparameter Strategy

#### Learning Rate Scaling by Model Size

| T0 | 29M | 1.5e-3 | Can tolerate higher LR |
| T1 | 50M | 1.2e-4 | Moderate for attention |
| T2 | 210M | 8.0e-5 | Hybrid architecture |
| T3 | 250M | 9.0e-5 | Cross-task learning |
| T4 | 280M | 8.0e-5 | Cross-modal fusion |
| T5 | 320M | 7.5e-5 | **Sweet spot** for 300-400M params at batch 32 |

**Why 7.5e-5 for T5?**
- 1e-4 is slightly hot for:
  - Stacked attention layers
  - Temporal gradients (backprop through time)
  - Dynamic convolution updates
- 7.5e-5 balances:
  - Fast enough convergence
  - Stable gradient flow
  - Prevents attention collapse

#### Weight Decay: 0.05 (Not 0.0001)

**Problem with 0.0001**:
- Too low for 300M+ parameter models
- High overfitting risk
- Model is too expressive without regularization

**Why 0.05 works**:
- Strong enough to prevent overfitting
- Not so strong it kills learning
- Standard for large transformer-like models

#### Loss Weight Rebalancing

**Previous Problem**:
```yaml
box_regression: 5.0  # Tyrannical
scene_description: 0.1  # Muted
scene_graph: 0.1  # Muted
```

**Why this fails**:
- Box regression dominates early training
- Semantic tasks never get enough signal
- GradNorm can't fully rescue extreme imbalance

**Rebalanced Solution**:
```yaml
box_regression: 3.0  # Still important, not dominant
scene_description: 0.3  # Above activation threshold
scene_graph: 0.3  # Above activation threshold
```

**Activation Threshold (0.3)**:
- Below 0.3: Task effectively doesn't learn
- Above 0.3: Task gets real gradient signal
- GradNorm can fine-tune from here

#### Data Loader: num_workers = 8

**Why increase from 4?**
- Model is **compute-bound** (GPU waits for data)
- Starving GPU murders throughput
- 8 workers keeps GPU fed during forward/backward

**Trade-off**:
- More memory usage
- Worth it for 2-3x throughput improvement

#### Warmup: 20 epochs (T5)

**Why longer warmup?**
- Gives GradNorm time to stabilize
- Temporal models need gradual ramp-up
- Prevents early collapse of attention mechanisms

#### min_lr: 1e-6

**Why add minimum LR?**
- Prevents late-stage collapse
- Temporal heads can overfit late in training
- Keeps model learning even at end

### Task Balancing: GradNorm

**GradNorm** (`ml/training/task_balancing.py`):
- Adaptive loss balancing across all heads
- Prevents gradient warfare
- Auto-dampening for problematic heads

**Why This Matters**: Without balancing, detection head dominates, other heads fail. With balancing, all heads learn together.

**How it works** - Complete Step-by-Step Algorithm:

**Step 1: Compute Gradient Norms for Each Task**
```python
# For each task i:
weighted_loss_i = task_weights[i] * loss_i
gradients_i = torch.autograd.grad(
    weighted_loss_i, 
    shared_params,  # Backbone, FPN parameters
    retain_graph=True,
    create_graph=False
)
# Flatten all gradients into single vector
grad_vector = torch.cat([g.flatten() for g in gradients_i])
gradient_norm_i = torch.norm(grad_vector, p=2)  # L2 norm
```

**Step 2: Compute Relative Training Rates**
```python
# On first iteration, record initial losses
if iteration == 0:
    initial_losses = [loss.detach() for loss in task_losses]

# Compute relative loss (current / initial)
relative_loss_i = current_loss_i / (initial_loss_i + 1e-8)

# Relative inverse training rate
# Higher relative loss = slower learning = needs more gradient
relative_inverse_rate_i = (relative_loss_i) ** alpha

Where:
- alpha = 1.5 (restoring force hyperparameter)
- If task is learning slowly (high relative_loss), it gets higher gradient norm
- Example: If task loss decreased by 50%, relative_loss = 0.5, rate = 0.5^1.5 = 0.35
```

**Step 3: Compute Target Gradient Norms**
```python
# Average gradient norm across all tasks
avg_grad_norm = torch.stack(gradient_norms).mean()

# Target gradient norm for each task
target_grad_norm_i = avg_grad_norm * relative_inverse_rate_i

# Intuition: Tasks with slower learning get higher target gradient norm
# This ensures they receive more gradient signal
```

**Step 4: Compute GradNorm Loss**
```python
# L1 loss between actual and target gradient norms
gradnorm_loss = torch.sum(
    torch.abs(gradient_norms - target_grad_norms)
)

# This loss measures how far actual gradient norms are from targets
# Minimizing this loss balances gradient norms across tasks
```

**Step 5: Update Task Weights**
```python
# Gradient of GradNorm loss w.r.t. task weights
grad_w = torch.autograd.grad(
    gradnorm_loss,
    task_weights,
    retain_graph=False
)

# Update weights (gradient descent)
task_weights = task_weights - lr_gradnorm * grad_w

# Clamp weights to prevent extreme values
task_weights = torch.clamp(task_weights, min=0.1, max=10.0)

Where:
- lr_gradnorm = 0.025 (learning rate for weight updates)
- Weights updated every N iterations (typically 100)
- Clamping prevents weights from becoming too extreme
```

**Complete Algorithm Pseudocode**:
```python
def gradnorm_update(model, task_losses, task_weights, shared_params, iteration):
    # Step 1: Compute gradient norms
    gradient_norms = []
    for i, loss in enumerate(task_losses):
        weighted_loss = task_weights[i] * loss
        grads = torch.autograd.grad(
            weighted_loss, 
            shared_params, 
            retain_graph=True
        )
        grad_norm = torch.norm(torch.cat([g.flatten() for g in grads]))
        gradient_norms.append(grad_norm)
    
    # Step 2: Initialize reference losses (first iteration only)
    if iteration == 0:
        initial_losses = [loss.detach() for loss in task_losses]
        return task_weights  # No update on first iteration
    
    # Step 3: Compute relative losses
    relative_losses = [
        loss.detach() / (initial_loss + 1e-8) 
        for loss, initial_loss in zip(task_losses, initial_losses)
    ]
    
    # Step 4: Compute target gradient norms
    avg_grad_norm = torch.stack(gradient_norms).mean()
    relative_inverse_rates = [r ** 1.5 for r in relative_losses]
    target_grad_norms = [
        avg_grad_norm * r 
        for r in relative_inverse_rates
    ]
    
    # Step 5: Compute GradNorm loss
    gradnorm_loss = torch.sum(
        torch.abs(
            torch.stack(gradient_norms) - 
            torch.stack(target_grad_norms)
        )
    )
    
    # Step 6: Update task weights
    grad_w = torch.autograd.grad(gradnorm_loss, task_weights)
    task_weights = task_weights - 0.025 * grad_w
    task_weights = torch.clamp(task_weights, min=0.1, max=10.0)
    
    return task_weights, gradnorm_loss.item()
```

**Why This Works**:
- **Prevents Gradient Warfare**: Tasks with conflicting gradients are balanced automatically
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Tasks that learn slowly get more gradient signal (higher weight)
- **Automatic Tuning**: No manual loss weight tuning required
- **Stable Training**: Prevents one task from dominating others
- **Self-Correcting**: If a task starts learning too fast, its weight decreases automatically

**Auto-Dampening for Extreme Gradients**:
```python
# If gradient norm is too extreme, dampen it
if gradient_norm_i > 10 * avg_grad_norm:
    # Extreme gradient detected
    task_weights[i] = task_weights[i] * 0.5  # Reduce weight by 50%
    logger.warning(f"Task {i} has extreme gradient, dampening weight")
```

### Transfer Learning: T2 → T5

**Strategy**: Leverage stable 210M-param spatial model to bootstrap 320M-param temporal system.

**Mathematical Formulation**:
```
# Weight transfer
θ_T5_spatial = θ_T2_spatial  # Copy spatial weights
θ_T5_temporal = RandomInit()  # Random init temporal weights

# Parameter grouping for different learning rates
θ_groups = {
    'cnn': θ_T5_spatial[:cnn_params],
    'vit': θ_T5_spatial[cnn_params:cnn_params+vit_params],
    'detection': θ_T5_spatial[cnn_params+vit_params:detection_params],
    'temporal': θ_T5_temporal,
    'new_heads': θ_T5_new_heads
}

# Learning rates per group
lr_groups = {
    'cnn': base_lr * 0.2,
    'vit': base_lr * 0.5,
    'detection': base_lr * 0.6,
    'temporal': base_lr * 1.0,
    'new_heads': base_lr * 1.3
}
```

**Freeze Schedule** - Detailed Implementation:

**Epochs 0-5: Freeze CNN + ViT, Train New T5 Heads Only**
```python

        }
```

**Why This Schedule Works**:
- **Early Phase (0-10)**: Establishes strong detection baseline before adding complexity
- **Mid Phase (10-25)**: Adds navigation tasks (motion, navigation difficulty) that depend on detection
- **Late Phase (25-40)**: Adds therapy/urgency tasks that depend on both detection and navigation
- **Final Phase (40+)**: Enables all tasks once representation is ready

**Behavior**:
- **Epochs 0-5**: Metrics noisy, loss spikes (temporal heads learning)
- **Epochs 5-15**: Detection stabilizes (detection heads adapting)
- **Epochs 15-30**: Navigation loss drops (ViT adapting)
- **Epochs 30-45**: Temporal heads wake up (full ViT + temporal)
- **Epochs 45-70**: T5 surpasses T2 (full model training)
- **Epochs 70+**: Diminishing returns (fine-tuning)

### Performance Targets

- **Stage A Latency**: <150ms (target: <100ms)
- **Stage B Latency**: <500ms (opportunistic)
- **Model Size**: <50MB (quantized)
- **Battery Drain**: <12% per hour normal use
- **Detection Accuracy**: >85% in varied environments

### Safety Metrics (More Important Than Accuracy)

- **False Reassurance Rate**: <1% (danger predicted as safe)
- **Alert Latency**: <200ms (time to first warning)
- **Information Overload Events**: <2 per minute
- **Silence Correctness**: >95% (when staying quiet was right)
- **Tier 1 Availability**: >99.9% (safety heads never disabled)
- **Uncertainty Calibration**: Well-calibrated (uncertainty correlates with actual error)

**Why Safety Metrics Matter**: mAP and accuracy don't capture safety. A 95% accurate system that gives false reassurance is worse than an 85% accurate system that's safe.

## Current Work & Next Steps

### Immediate next steps

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: 3.12+
- **PyTorch**: 2.5.0+ (with MPS support for Apple Silicon)
- **Hardware**: 
  - **Local Development**: Apple Silicon M1+ (MPS) or CPU
  - **Training**: Cloud GPU (CUDA) required for models >10k parameters
- **macOS**: Apple Silicon M1+ (for iOS development)
- **Xcode**: 16.1+ (for iOS app)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd 2026-Prototype

# Create virtual environment
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify installation
python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch {torch.__version__}, MPS: {torch.backends.mps.is_available()}')"
```

### Device Selection Policy

**Automatic device selection based on model size:**

- **Models < 10k parameters**: Automatically use **CPU** (smoke tests, small experiments)
- **Models >= 10k parameters**: Require **Cloud GPU (CUDA)** for training

**All MaxSight tiers (210M+ parameters) require cloud GPU for training.**

See **docs/status.md** for device and hardware notes.

### Requirements before training

1. **Install deps**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Prepare data**: Run once: `python scripts/gather_training_data.py` (optionally `--skip-download` / `--skip-extract` if COCO is already present). This creates `datasets/cleaned_splits/maxsight_train.json`, `maxsight_val.json`, `maxsight_test.json`.
3. **Hardware**: For full training use a CUDA GPU; for smoke/short runs CPU or MPS is fine.

See **docs/status.md** and **docs/downloads.md** for setup and data requirements.

### Smoke Training (Proof of Life)

```bash
# Tier choices: T0_BASELINE_CNN, T1_ATTENTION, T2_HYBRID_VIT, T3_CROSS_TASK, T4_CROSS_MODAL, T5_TEMPORAL
python scripts/smoke_train.py --tier T0_BASELINE_CNN --epochs 2 --batches 5

# Force CPU (short run only)
python scripts/smoke_train.py --tier T0_BASELINE_CNN --force-cpu --epochs 2 --batches 3
```

### Full Training (annotation-based; Cloud GPU recommended)

```bash
# After running gather_training_data.py, use the paths it prints:
python scripts/train_maxsight.py \
  --data-dir datasets/coco_raw \
  --train-annotation datasets/cleaned_splits/maxsight_train.json \
  --val-annotation datasets/cleaned_splits/maxsight_val.json \
  --image-dir datasets/coco_raw \
  --epochs 100 \
  --batch-size 32 \
  --device cuda \
  --use-gradnorm
```

Optional: run **AutoML** (Optuna) first, then train with best params:  
`python scripts/AutoMLType.py --data-dir ... --train-annotation ... --val-annotation ... --image-dir ...`  
Then: `python scripts/train_maxsight.py ... --hyperparameters checkpoints_tuning/best_hyperparameters.json`

### One-shot production training

To run env check, dataset check, optional data-pipeline validation, full training, and optional export in one go:

```bash
./scripts/run_production_training.sh
```

Options: `--skip-env`, `--skip-data-check`, `--no-export`, `--dry-run`. Override via env: `DATA_DIR`, `EPOCHS`, `BATCH_SIZE`, `LR`, `DEVICE`, `HYPERPARAMETERS` (path to `best_hyperparameters.json` from AutoMLType.py).  
Optional **Phase 3 data validation** (no invalid values; class weights):  
`python scripts/validate_data_pipeline.py --train-annotation datasets/cleaned_splits/maxsight_train.json --image-dir datasets/coco_raw`

### Validation and benchmarking

Use the test suite and training benchmark: `pytest tests/` and `python -m ml.training.benchmark`. See **docs/status.md** for current status.

from ml.training.transfer_learning import transfer_weights, create_param_groups
from ml.models.maxsight_cnn import MaxSightCNN
import torch

# Load T2 checkpoint
t2_checkpoint = torch.load('checkpoints/t2_best.pt')
t2_model = MaxSightCNN(tier='T2_HYBRID_VIT')
t2_model.load_state_dict(t2_checkpoint['model_state_dict'])

# Create T5 model
t5_model = MaxSightCNN(tier='T5_TEMPORAL')

# Transfer weights
transfer_weights(t2_model, t5_model)

# Create parameter groups with different learning rates
param_groups = create_param_groups(
    t5_model,
    base_lr=7.5e-5,
    lr_multipliers={
        'cnn': 0.2,
        'vit': 0.5,

    # Update freeze schedule
    freeze_schedule = get_freeze_schedule(epoch)
    apply_freeze_schedule(t5_model, freeze_schedule)
    
    # Get loss weights for this epoch
    loss_weights = get_loss_weights_for_epoch(epoch)

import torch
import time

# Load model
model = MaxSightCNN(tier='T5_TEMPORAL')
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('checkpoints/t5_best.pt'))
model.eval()

# Prepare input
image = load_image('test_image.jpg')  # [3, 224, 224]
image = preprocess(image)  # Normalize, resize
image = image.unsqueeze(0)  # [1, 3, 224, 224]

# Optional: Audio features
audio_features = extract_mfcc('test_audio.wav')  # [1, 128]

# Inference
with torch.no_grad():
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    
    # Forward pass (two-stage)
    outputs = model(
        images=image,
        audio_features=audio_features,
        use_temporal=False  # Single frame
    )
    
    latency = (time.perf_counter() - start_time) * 1000  # ms
    
    # Check if Stage B was executed
    if 'stage_b_executed' in outputs:
        print(f"Stage B executed: {outputs['stage_b_executed']}")
    
    # Access predictions
    detections = outputs['detections']  # List of detected objects
    urgency = outputs['urgency']  # [1, 4] urgency levels
    distance_zones = outputs['distance_zones']  # [1, H*W, 3]
    
    print(f"Latency: {latency:.2f}ms")

    model=model,
    output_path='exports/maxsight_t2.mlmodel',
    input_shape=(1, 3, 224, 224),
    quantization='int8'  # INT8 quantization for mobile
)

# Verify export
import coremltools as ct
mlmodel = ct.models.MLModel('exports/maxsight_t2.mlmodel')
print(f"Model size: {mlmodel.get_spec().ByteSize() / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB")
```

#### Troubleshooting Guide

**Problem 1: Out of Memory (OOM) During Training**

**Symptoms**:
```
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate X GB
```

**Solutions**:
```python
# 1. Reduce batch size
config['data']['batch_size'] = 4  # Instead of 8

# 2. Increase gradient accumulation (maintain effective batch size)
config['training']['accumulate_grad_batches'] = 8  # Effective batch = 4 * 8 = 32

# 3. Use gradient checkpointing
model.use_gradient_checkpointing = True

# 4. Use mixed precision training
config['training']['mixed_precision'] = True

# 5. Reduce model size (use lower tier)
model = MaxSightCNN(tier='T1_ATTENTION')  # Instead of T5_TEMPORAL
```

**Problem 2: Loss Not Decreasing**

**Symptoms**:
- Loss plateaus after a few epochs
- Loss increases instead of decreases
- Some heads have zero loss (not learning)

**Solutions**:
```python
# 1. Check learning rate (might be too high or too low)
# Use learning rate finder
from ml.training.lr_finder import find_lr
optimal_lr = find_lr(model, train_loader)
print(f"Optimal LR: {optimal_lr}")

# 2. Check if GradNorm is working
# Monitor gradient norms
gradnorm_metrics = trainer.get_gradnorm_metrics()
print(f"Gradient norms: {gradnorm_metrics}")

# 3. Check loss weights
# Some tasks might have weights too low
loss_weights = config['training']['loss_weights']
for task, weight in loss_weights.items():
    if weight < 0.3:
        print(f"Warning: {task} has low weight ({weight})")

# 4. Check data quality
# Verify annotations are correct
verify_annotations(dataset)

# 5. Check if model is frozen incorrectly
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    if not param.requires_grad:
        print(f"Warning: {name} is frozen")
```

**Problem 3: Stage B Always Skipped**

**Symptoms**:
- `stage_b_executed = False` for all samples
- Stage A latency consistently > 200ms
- Uncertainty always > 0.7

**Solutions**:
```python
# 1. Profile Stage A latency
import torch.profiler

with torch.profiler.profile(
    activities=[torch.profiler.ProfilerActivity.CPU, torch.profiler.ProfilerActivity.CUDA],
    record_shapes=True
) as prof:
    outputs = model(images)

print(prof.key_averages().table(sort_by="cuda_time_total"))

# 2. Optimize Stage A
# - Use smaller input size (224x224 instead of 320x320)
# - Reduce FPN levels (use P3, P4, P5 only, skip P2)
# - Use quantization (INT8)

# 3. Lower uncertainty threshold
config['inference']['uncertainty_threshold'] = 0.8  # Instead of 0.7

# 4. Increase latency threshold
config['inference']['latency_threshold_ms'] = 250  # Instead of 200
```

**Problem 4: GradNorm Not Working**

**Symptoms**:
- Task weights not updating
- Gradient norms all zero
- One task dominates training

**Solutions**:
```python
# 1. Check if shared parameters are correct
shared_params = list(model.backbone.parameters()) + list(model.fpn.parameters())
print(f"Shared params: {len(shared_params)}")

# 2. Check if retain_graph is set
# In task_balancing.py, ensure retain_graph=True

# 3. Check update interval
config['training']['gradnorm_update_interval'] = 100  # Update every 100 iterations

# 4. Check if task losses are valid
for task, loss in task_losses.items():
    if torch.isnan(loss) or torch.isinf(loss):
        print(f"Warning: {task} loss is invalid: {loss}")

# 5. Manually verify GradNorm
from ml.training.task_balancing import GradNormBalancer
balancer = GradNormBalancer(num_tasks=len(task_losses))
weights, metrics = balancer.update_task_weights(task_losses, gradient_norms)
print(f"Updated weights: {weights}")
```

**Problem 5: Export Fails**

**Symptoms**:
- CoreML export fails with tracing errors
- ONNX export produces invalid model
- ExecuTorch export fails

**Solutions**:
```python
# 1. CoreML: Use torch.jit.script instead of torch.jit.trace
# Tracing fails with dynamic control flow
scripted_model = torch.jit.script(model)
coreml_model = ct.convert(scripted_model, ...)

# 2. ONNX: Specify input/output names
torch.onnx.export(
    model,
    dummy_input,
    'model.onnx',
    input_names=['images', 'audio_features'],
    output_names=['detections', 'urgency', 'distance'],
    dynamic_axes={
        'images': {0: 'batch_size'},
        'audio_features': {0: 'batch_size'}
    }
)

# 3. ExecuTorch: Use export_to_executorch helper
from ml.training.export import export_to_executorch
export_to_executorch(model, 'model.pte', quantization='int8')
```

#### Performance Optimization Techniques

**1. Model Quantization**
```python
# INT8 Quantization (4x size reduction)
from ml.training.quantization import quantize_model

quantized_model = quantize_model(
    model,
    calibration_data=calibration_loader,
    quantization_type='int8'
)

# Verify accuracy
fp32_accuracy = evaluate(model, test_loader)
int8_accuracy = evaluate(quantized_model, test_loader)
print(f"Accuracy drop: {fp32_accuracy - int8_accuracy:.2f}%")
```

**2. Pruning**
```python
# Structured pruning (remove entire channels)
from ml.optimization.mobile_optimizations import prune_model

pruned_model = prune_model(
    model,
    pruning_ratio=0.3,  # Remove 30% of channels
    method='structured'
)

# Fine-tune pruned model
trainer = TrainingLoop(pruned_model, ...)
trainer.train(num_epochs=10)  # Fine-tune for 10 epochs
```

**3. Knowledge Distillation**
```python
# Distill T5 (teacher) to T2 (student)
from ml.training.self_supervised_pretrain import KnowledgeDistillationLoss

teacher = MaxSightCNN(tier='T5_TEMPORAL')
student = MaxSightCNN(tier='T2_HYBRID_VIT')

kd_loss_fn = KnowledgeDistillationLoss(
    temperature=4.0,
    alpha=0.7  # 70% teacher, 30% ground truth
)

# Training loop
for batch in train_loader:
    teacher_outputs = teacher(batch['images'])
    student_outputs = student(batch['images'])
    
    loss = kd_loss_fn(
        student_outputs,
        teacher_outputs,
        batch['targets']
    )
    
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

#### Advanced Usage Examples

**Example: Custom Head Implementation**
```python
from ml.models.heads import BaseHead
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomAccessibilityHead(BaseHead):
    """Custom head for accessibility-specific task."""
    
    def __init__(self, input_dim, num_classes):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, 256)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, num_classes)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.1)
    
    def forward(self, features):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(features))
        x = self.dropout(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Integrate into model
model.custom_head = CustomAccessibilityHead(input_dim=512, num_classes=10)
```

**Example: Custom Loss Function**
```python
from ml.training.losses import BaseLoss
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomAccessibilityLoss(BaseLoss):
    """Custom loss for accessibility task."""
    
    def __init__(self, alpha=0.5):
        super().__init__()
        self.alpha = alpha
        self.ce_loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
        self.mse_loss = nn.MSELoss()
    
    def forward(self, predictions, targets):
        # Combined classification and regression loss
        cls_loss = self.ce_loss(predictions['cls'], targets['cls'])
        reg_loss = self.mse_loss(predictions['reg'], targets['reg'])
        
        total_loss = self.alpha * cls_loss + (1 - self.alpha) * reg_loss
        return total_loss
